But I love Terraria tonight. 

I'm an easy target when it comes to mindless clicking. I assume it's because I am simple minded, but few games satisfy like ones that require hours of grinding. World of Warcraft worked on me: hours turned into YEARS playing that game. Minecraft? Oh yea. One of the first couple thousand alpha players right here folks! I'm not sure who that would impress, but I am sure I don't want to meet that person. It comforts a very basic part of my brain when I can click away for a few hours and call it "productive" which is why I keep playing these games. Terraria requires just, _massive_ amounts of clicking, which makes me warm inside. Well, more warm. Pot makes me pretty warm too, and makes this game go from good to __great!__

For those who don't know, and I don't know how you found this blog but _not_ Terraria, it's usually described as a 2D, side scrolling version of Minecraft. You explore a procedurally generated world full of monsters and caverns, collecting whatever ingredients you can to help fuel your progress. It's perfectly fair to compare Minecraft and Terraria, but it's reductive to stop at "side scrolling Minecraft." Yes, they share a similar elevator pitch, but beyond that they are very different games and I think that Terraria is the better game.
