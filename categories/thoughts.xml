It's been a while, and lord how I've missed it! As it stands I'm updating the website, updating my [Soundcloud](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha&lt;/a&gt;) as well as my [Twitter](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/al_hacha"&gt;https://twitter.com/al_hacha&lt;/a&gt;) accounts. It will be some time before I have everything up and running smoothly, but hopefully sooner than later I'll have this all intergrated. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of facebook. I'm sure there are papers (written by facebook) that point out the power of using facebook, but I just don't buy it. So no facebook page, but why would I need one? I have this page.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>update</category><category>news</category><category>thoughts</category><category>blog</category><guid>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/moved-on.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2014 12:26:46 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
