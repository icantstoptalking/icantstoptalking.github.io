&lt;p&gt;I put a new song up today &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/strange-dance"&gt;A Strange Dance&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to describe, I don't really think about any sort of classification when I'm making a song, I just kind of go for it. This one definitely came out as a dance song though. Very lively, very happy. I used a lot of major chords, kept it very simple. I like songs like this, because there is a nod to the current trend in electronic music and dance music, but I think it's more musical than the stuff on the radio. There is a definite beginning, middle and end to the song. Overall I guess I made a dance song that I'd want to dance to, rather than a dance song that would be popular right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm terrible at promoting my self, and I'm trying to get better through this page. So today I'm actually going to remember to remind anyone reading: don't forget to click the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/al_hacha"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; link at the top of the page as well as my &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; link. Follow me on both, it will make you feel toasty warm in your nether regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye for now, don't forget to DANCE!&lt;/p&gt;
