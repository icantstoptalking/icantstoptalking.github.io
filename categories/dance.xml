&lt;p&gt;Hello, hello, hello! We're back again, this time with nothing but music! Behold, &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/dance-floor-produced-by-chef-f"&gt;Dance Floor&lt;/a&gt;, by me! With beats by &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/dance-floor-produced-by-chef-f"&gt;Chef F&lt;/a&gt; from his lovely new collection of hip-hop instrumentals &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/dance-floor-produced-by-chef-f"&gt;Aboard The Mothership&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to enjoy my song as well as Chef Fs album, both are more than worth your time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on a few comments about the brewing YouTube debacle, but I'm waiting for more information whilst I polish my prose. Until then, brave citizens, enjoy! Don't forget to follow me on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=Al_Hacha"&gt;@Al_Hacha&lt;/a&gt;  for all the updates you'll see here, but in a much smaller form. Again, don't forget to follow me on &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, just to encourage you we'll exit on a song, my latest: &lt;iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/49201073&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_artwork=true&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>music</category><category>dance</category><category>Update</category><category>collaboration</category><guid>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/dance-floor-for-your-feet.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2014 12:47:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Strange Dance</title><link>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/a-strange-dance.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Just a new song.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put a new song up today &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/strange-dance"&gt;A Strange Dance&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to describe, I don't really think about any sort of classification when I'm making a song, I just kind of go for it. This one definitely came out as a dance song though. Very lively, very happy. I used a lot of major chords, kept it very simple. I like songs like this, because there is a nod to the current trend in electronic music and dance music, but I think it's more musical than the stuff on the radio. There is a definite beginning, middle and end to the song. Overall I guess I made a dance song that I'd want to dance to, rather than a dance song that would be popular right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm terrible at promoting my self, and I'm trying to get better through this page. So today I'm actually going to remember to remind anyone reading: don't forget to click the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/al_hacha"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; link at the top of the page as well as my &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; link. Follow me on both, it will make you feel toasty warm in your nether regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye for now, don't forget to DANCE!&lt;/p&gt;
