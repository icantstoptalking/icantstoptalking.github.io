&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, my newest song: &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/nerd-plays-games"&gt;Nerd Plays Games&lt;/a&gt;. I think the title pretty well explains the song. I'm a nerd, I play games, I made a song about it. I doubt very much this will be the last time I feel like writing a song about games. I'm sure everyone will love it of course. If, in fact, you do love my music, I'd advise you to follow me on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=Al_Hacha"&gt;@Al_Hacha&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Another Day, Another Rant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus H. Christ people, how stupid are you? Every time someone tries to monetize their site (which sits on a real server that costs real money to host) or to change the policies to expand their income, people on the Internet who rely on said service go ape shit. Now, that seems like I'm being a dick. These people use the service and then suddenly the policy changes, so why shouldn't they be mad? Isn't it right for someone who is used to being able to advertise for free using Facebook, to be upset when Facebook pushes down their posts in favor of ads? Shouldn't SoundCloud users be upset that they no longer have somewhere to publish their unlicensed remixes? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't catch the tone there, I am being sarcastic. It's utter nonsense, every bit of it. Every time this happens and people on the Internet throw a fit, I can't help but think it's their fault. How? I'll explain. &lt;/p&gt;
