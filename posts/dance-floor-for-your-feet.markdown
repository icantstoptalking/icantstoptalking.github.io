Hello, hello, hello! We're back again, this time with nothing but music! Behold, [Dance Floor](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/dance-floor-produced-by-chef-f), by me! With beats by [Chef F](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/dance-floor-produced-by-chef-f) from his lovely new collection of hip-hop instrumentals [Aboard The Mothership](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/dance-floor-produced-by-chef-f). I encourage you to enjoy my song as well as Chef Fs album, both are more than worth your time!

I'm currently working on a few comments about the brewing YouTube debacle, but I'm waiting for more information whilst I polish my prose. Until then, brave citizens, enjoy! Don't forget to sign up for my [twitter](https://twitter.com/al_hacha) for all the updates you'll see here, but in a much smaller form. Again, don't forget to follow me on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha), just to encourage you we'll exit on a song, my latest, Dance Floor:<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/49201073&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>
