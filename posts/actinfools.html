    <div><h3>As always, music first</h3>
<p>First and foremost, my newest song: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/nerd-plays-games">Nerd Plays Games</a>. I think the title pretty well explains the song. I'm a nerd, I play games, I made a song about it. I doubt very much this will be the last time I feel like writing a song about games. I'm sure everyone will love it of course. If, in fact, you do love my music, I'd advise you to follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=Al_Hacha">@Al_Hacha</a> and on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha">SoundCloud</a></p>
<h3>Another Day, Another Rant</h3>
<p>Jesus H. Christ people, how stupid are you? Every time someone tries to monetize their site (which sits on a real server that costs real money to host) or to change the policies to expand their income, people on the Internet who rely on said service go ape shit. Now, that seems like I'm being a dick. These people use the service and then suddenly the policy changes, so why shouldn't they be mad? Isn't it right for someone who is used to being able to advertise for free using Facebook, to be upset when Facebook pushes down their posts in favor of ads? Shouldn't SoundCloud users be upset that they no longer have somewhere to publish their unlicensed remixes? </p>
<p>If you didn't catch the tone there, I am being sarcastic. It's utter nonsense, every bit of it. Every time this happens and people on the Internet throw a fit, I can't help but think it's their fault. How? I'll explain. </p>
<!-- Teaser_End -->

<h3>You Should Have Seen This Coming, Part Deux</h3>
<p>OK guys, come on. We've talked about this, <em>THIS YEAR.</em> When do you get stuff for free in the rest of your life? And how often in the modern world has advertising, marketing, exposure to the public, been free? Our content, your content, means nothing to them on an individual basis. They could give a shit less about you in particular. They need users, sure, but Facebook, YouTube and clearly now SoundCloud, don't rely on your crap to bring them in. Why would they? So a couple thousand indie artists get mad and leave SoundCloud, jeez, I wonder if their deals with record labels can in any way replace the loss of your crappy, unlicensed remix. </p>
<p>Get real guys. The Internet has a business model and we know what it is. Every time you sign up for a free service that couldn't possible exist in a brick and mortar version, you know it's not going to be permanent. That's the point of giving us free stuff up front: get us in and make us dependent on them. It's <em>your</em> fault for thinking that you could use these places for free hosting and advertising. You idiots gave them this power, by being ignorant as hell. By buying into their sales pitch, you made this happen. </p>
<p>Here's the bottom line: They have what we want, not the other way around. They have the audience, so they have the power. Expecting them not to use it is silly. Of course they are going to use that power. That's business. You don't spend millions of dollars just to help out a bunch of starving artists. You do it to build a business and to hopefully be able to take advantage of the huge audiences these sites can build up. You're not getting screwed, not at all. If anything, you were screwing your self when you based your model for success on using only free services that are clearly unsustainable in the long term. </p>
<h3>That Was Cold Man</h3>
<p>Clearly, I use SoundCloud, but I know why I'm using it and I know what kind of company they are. Right now, they are more useful to me than I am to them. I don't even use Facebook, why would I with a real web page? I use Twitter, but again, I know what kind of company it is and I'm realistic about it. In my world, the real world, Facebook or YouTube or whatever, are not magical gateways to success and popularity. They aren't screwing me over if they change, any of them. It's great that it's so easy to share now, and I'll take advantage of that, but I know that sooner or later you still have to actually spend money to make money.</p>
<p>I think most people don't really understand how the real world works. It's delusional and I don't feel the least bit sorry for them. Build a web page, print out fliers, sell music through services meant to sell music, don't rely on some magic website to catapult you to fame. Just live in the real world. </p>
<p>Here's a song about dumb asses, it's fitting.  </p>
