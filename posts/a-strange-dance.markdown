##Just a new song. 

I put a new song up today [A Strange Dance](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/strange-dance). It's hard to describe, I don't really think about any sort of classification when I'm making a song, I just kind of go for it. This one definately came out as a dance song though. Very lively, very happy. I used a lot of major chords, kept it very simple. I like songs like this, because there is a nod to the current trend in electronic music and dance music, but I think it's more musical than the stuff on the radio. There is a definate beginning, middle and end to the song. Overall I guess I made a dance song that I'd want to dance to, rather than a dance song that would be popular right now. 

I'm terrible at promoting my self, and I'm trying to get better through this page. So today I'm actually going to remember to remind anyone reading: don't forget to click the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/al_hacha) link at the top of the page as well as my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha) link. Follow me on both, it will make you feel toasty warm in your nether regions. 

Goodbye for now, don't forget to DANCE!
