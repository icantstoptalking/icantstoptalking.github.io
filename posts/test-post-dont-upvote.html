    <p>I can't stop talking is my "culture" blog. God I hate that phrase, but for lack of a better...</p>
<p>What can't I stop talking about? Nonsense that only other dorks would care about. I'm <em>deeply</em> interested in Thor: The Dark World. I subscribe, and contribute to, the Dwarf Fortress subreddit. Speaking of reddit, I can't stop talking about trolling GTA V fans on /r/gaming. I often talk at length about craft beer or home brewing; I know very little about either but I do know how to drink awesome beer. I play video games, main stream and indie. I don't care about the console vs. PC fight but I love watching people fight about it. </p>
<p>There are lots of things I can't stop talking about. For the most part the things I talk about are pretty petty - mostly I pontificate on whatever entertainment media I happen to be occupied with at the moment. I admit that it's not a grand path, but I also admit that I'm not a grand person. </p>
<p>Occasionally though, I will offer an insight of a more serious nature. I am worried about the state of the country and I will probably embarrass my self talking about it. I care a great deal about the culture I partake in, I'm a proud nerd I like talking about it. I worry too much about the state of the economy, the state of art in America, the consumer culture. There are <em>lots</em> of things I care about. What do they all have in common? </p>
<p>I know next to <em>nothing</em> about any of it. I have no education and no training on how one would professionally critique anything at all. I can't solve any problems and I am certainly no great thinker. If I am a philosopher, then I am a poor one. </p>
<p>I am, however, very passionate about all of it, all the stupid shit I pursue. My moods are mercurial and whatever I am interested in at the moment is what I love with my whole heart, for the moment. I've been a home brewer, an art student, a mechanic, a furniture mover and a laborer with a crew of illegals who taught me the Spanish word for prostitute. I role play, play video games, enjoy movies, TV, music and getting furious with strangers on reddit. In short, I'm not special at all and that's fine. Most people aren't special and as fun as it is to read articles by those who are inside the systems, those who get early game releases and private brewery tours, it's also worth hearing what a nobody thinks. We are all nobodies, for the most part. It's interesting to hear what a nobody thinks as long as that no body can turn a phrase. </p>
<p>And turn a phrase I can! Don't worry: I have plenty of stupid things to say and all the time in the world to say them. Take my hand as we explore the world of some idiot who can't stop talking, even when no body cares.    </p>
