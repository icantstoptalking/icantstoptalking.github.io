##First, the good news...

Just a quick rant today. I uploaded a few new tracks to my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha), got this website cleaned up and finally added all the buttons I want. I'm sure there will be more later, but for now this is more than enough. I think the next time I'm going to completely remake my web page is when I'm ready to have a "give me money for my music" link. Also, computers are just terrible. 

###Your music isn't your identity

Again, a music rant. This one isn't so much about making music as much as it is bitching about people who feel the need to make music their entire identity. We've all met them, we all know them, and god if they aren't awful. These are the people who don't own a single t-shirt without some band name, the more obscure the better. I'm pretty sure they buy those shirts just so you'll ask them about the band; it's well known that douches love saying "Oh, you've never heard of *blank*, I guess you're just not into music as much as I am." 

God, what wankers. It's a cop out, they don't really have anything interesting to add to the world so instead they try to get laid/make friends by having very onerous opinions about music, and those opinions make up the entirety of their personality.
