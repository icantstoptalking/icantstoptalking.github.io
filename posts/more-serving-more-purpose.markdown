Back with more noise for the holes in your head! Relax and enjoy [Servile Purpose](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/servile-purpose). I think it's about finished, so I'd like to talk about it a little bit, but first I need to do a little shilling!

If anyone is reading this, and *everyone* should be reading this, remember to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/al_hacha) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha) if you enjoy updates and thoughts at random. Please, make sure to dish out the "likes" like it's candy, every bit of encouragement helps makes this work (and helps me sell it to the ball and chain.) People say all this social networking is vital, and I suppose it is, but I think it's more vital for an established artist than for a "in the making" sort of performer such as my self. Oh well, even if I'm shouting into the wilderness, at least I'm shouting.

##The Meat Of The Beat

This song is the first song I've done that feels like I'm finding a style. I say that because I didn't go into this one to learn, or to try a style of music. Instead, every step so far I've thought "What sounds do *I* like?". This is weird for me, because I've been learning about this for years now and I'm used to approaching the track as someone who needs to learn more before he can make a song. This time I just made the song I wanted to hear. I guess, if I had to describe what I've done, I'd say that it's a rap beat as interpreted by me. 

I guess that's pretty vague, so let me explain: I like way too many genres of music, and they kind of blend in my head, so this is what I get when I say "I'm making a rap song" and then pick the sounds I like and arrange them in a way that also pleases me. It is arranged as a rap song, it doesn't have a melody except to accompany the rhythm, but I've used way more rock sounds than typical rap sounds. I didn't set out to do a rock'n'rap song, I just picked what I wanted to make a rap song that I'd personally like to rap over. 

It's just, well damn, it's just what I would like. I like guitar sounds, but I also like rap. Personally, one of the most common things I've heard about making music that will be interesting to other people, is to make music that is interesting to you first. Or rather, don't try and make a song you think people want to hear, make a song that *you* want to hear. So that's what I did. Either way, it could certainly be rapped over and it should be! 

If anyone wants to rap over it feel free to do so, just give credit and if you're interested in custom beats please [email me](mailto:icsttemp@gmail.com).

Goodbye for now, check back soon for more beats and more stupid thoughts!
