So I finally got the internet back. It's been a while, and lord how I've missed it! As it stands I'm updating the website, updating my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha) as well as my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/al_hacha) accounts. It will be some time before I have everything up and running smoothly, but hopefully sooner than later I'll have this all intergrated. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of facebook. I'm sure there are papers (written by facebook) that point out the power of using facebook, but I just don't buy it. So no facebook page, but why would I need one? I have this page.
