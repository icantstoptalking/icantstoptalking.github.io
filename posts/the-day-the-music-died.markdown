Hello and welcome everybody. It's been a few days, I apologize to all the bots that crawl my site looking for spamable information. Two things on the agenda today, a new track and the brewing YouTube controversy. First, the track!

##The Music, baby. 

I like to peruse a certain [subreddit](www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop) and recently I decided to enter their weekly contest, the "Spit This Challenge" where aspiring emcees are tasked with "spitting" 16 bars over a beat chosen by the last weeks winner. You are also given a theme to rap about, it's sort of like school assignments where the rules are the real key to creativity. Here's my entry, creatively titled [MHH Cypher 24](https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/mhh-cypher-24) the original beat we rapped over is [Stoned Bliss, by Dope Matic](https://soundcloud.com/dopematic/stoned-bliss). The prompt was "Whats been on your mind lately?" I thought it was fun. I'm not going to win, I'm sure, there are actually a hand full of pretty damn talented rappers who compete and I'm just not at their level yet. Either way, it was a good challenge and I certainly don't think it was wasted time. 

##YouTube "Controversy"

So, if you haven't heard because you're not a music dork, YouTube has announced a few things that are pissing people off. I'll be upfront about this: YouTube/Google has yet to release an actual, factual press release delineating everything. At the moment all of YouTube's official communication is through the news agencies, I couldn't find any offical press release, only their qoutes through new sources. What we know for sure is that YouTube is going to launch YouTube music soon, a pay to play streaming service. I'm not going to rehash the many articles available about this, it's not really their new plans for a paid streaming service that caused the uproar with indies, it's their new contracts. 

Truthfully, no one seems to know for sure what exactly YouTubes plans are but the crux of the issue is the apparent threat to remove or block any commerical music that doesn't have an agreement with YouTube. [There](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/06/18/youtube-music-indie-dispute/10730315/) are [tons](http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/06/18/is-youtube-really-going-to-block-indie-acts/) of [news sites](http://www.digitaltrends.com/music/youtube-blocks-indie-label-artists/) that are all reporting the same thing, based of the same interview (that I can't link to because the Financial Times uses a pay wall) wherein YouTube head of content and business operation Rober Kyncl said that videos will be removed if the labels behind them don't agree to YouTubes terms. This seems to be comfirmed by reports of indepdenat labels who say that YouTube is continuing to threaten them with removals if they don't sign up. 

Ok, that's the basics, I'm not a news reporter and it's already being well covered. Nothing is written in stone yet and no one truthfully knows what's going to happen, but I do have a few things to point out about this that lots of people seems to be missing, internet commentators and professionals alike. 

##Deja Vu

I feel like I'm writing about FaceBook again. Of *course* they were going to eventually crack down and start monetizing every aspect of their business. Who amd I talking about? **EVERY BUSINESS EVER**! Come on people, why do we insist on burying our heads in the sand and acting like Google isn't just another big company. I'm sure way back in the mists of time people thought GE was a benevlent giant. How'd that work out? 

I'm going to break down the real issue: people are mad that digital music giants are acting just like record companies. I think, when you put it like that, it seems pretty obvioius doesn't it? Lets go further, just in case. Musicians, and I suppose creatives in general but I really only know the music side, are starting to get squeezed for the free services they have used for over a decade now. Valuable, vital services that you had to pay for *any other time but the last decade*. See the rub? That is literally what it comes down to: something that was free (hell, some people got paid by Google) is now not. I point this out because that's not what people are saying. 

##It's our right to use your service, damnit!

The complaints aren't "how dare you charge us for a valuable service!" it's "How dare you take this away, that's not right, it's unfair!" I think the difference between those two statements are pretty clear, isn't it? The people who are upset by it (not the actual labels, the commenters on the internet) are trying to make this a moral issue. They even delude them selves into saying that YouTube is going to hurt it's self with this move. Well, aside from the fact that they the experts and the motivation to study something like this before making the decisian, it's pretty clear that it wont. Saying that this move will hurt YouTube assumes that the content providers have the power. They do not. Artists rely on YouTube much, much more than YouTube depends on them. 

Don't forget, YouTube made it's bones by being a *community* video sharing platform. The very heart and soul of YouTube, which is still alive today, is the fact that it's easy for every single person to share and enjoy videos from around the world. They are giving hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the record companies in royalties, compared to the millions of dollars THEY make when they don't have to pay someone shit, because it's a cat falling off a porch. The only reason they pay royalties is because the RIAA has the money to sue them, the whole business model of YouTube is "We're not asking you to use our service, we're letting you, we get to keep the ad money because it costs us money to host your stupid video." 

Up until now they have had kind of shaky relationships with the commercial side of thier business. It's seemed like they weren't sure what to do with it for a long time. The've figured out what to do now. It was obvious all along. 

##Oh no, a for profit company is acting like one!

Come on people, grow up. Google exists to make money, not make your life better. From their point of view, and I tend to agree with this, we are very lucky they don't charge for every little thing. They certainly have the right to demand payment for any service of theirs you take advantage of. No one has the "right" to anything Google provides, and that includes YouTube. It took hundreds of man hours and millions of lines of code, not to mention service costs and bandwith costs to make and maintain YouTube. There is huge value just in that, let alone it's value as an advertising platform. They have the power here, not us. We like their services, we use them and in some cases depend on them. It should be clear, but I think it's kind of scary to most people and they prefer to just think of Google as a friendly giant. 

People saw YouTube and said "it's free, great, I'll use it to advertise my x" and for the past decade or more they have allowed it. Hell, they even helped people by creating a monetization system to share profits when videos get popular enough. That has been nice, but it's not good business and anyone who doesn't think is kidding them selves. TV charges, Radio, Newspaper. All the mass media has *always* charged for ads. "But wait!" you might say "They already charge people for ads, it practically ruined YouTube!" If you said that, you're an idiot. YouTube started playing ads because they had to find a way to not make it a black hole for money. It costs millions to run those servers and pay for that bandwidth and they weren't making any. 

It just doesn't make sense for YouTube to allow people to use YouTube as a commerical platform and not charge for it, not make a contract that is as equitable to them as it is to the content providers. They have to pay to play your music video, why shouldn't you have to agree to their terms first? Thats business, thats common sense. The content providers are getting access to HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of viewers, and YouTube has to pay out royalties if it's a musican with a record deal. Wether or not the artist gets the money is not relevent to this conversation, either way YouTube has to shell out royalties if they play a song owned by a major record label. Why keep that on their if they aren't going to start getting a fair share of the profits?

##What's your alternative?

I think what really makes people angry is ther eis no where else to go. You can't make your own website that can handle the millions of people you hope will watch your video. All the other video sites are sickly babies compared to YouTube.
