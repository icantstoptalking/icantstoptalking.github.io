    <div><h3>First, the following:</h3>
<p>Just a quick rant today. I uploaded a few new tracks to my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha">SoundCloud</a>, got this website cleaned up and finally added all the buttons I want. I'm sure there will be more later, but for now this is more than enough. I think the next time I'm going to completely remake my web page is when I'm ready to have a "give me money for my music" link. Also, computers are just terrible. I encourage anyone who thinks that computers are "easy money" to spend their day forcing tools meant for <a href="http://linuxfonts.narod.ru/why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html">Linux</a> to work on <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/461353-10-Reasons-why-Windows-still-sucks">Windows</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I got <a href="getnikola.com">Nikola</a> working after trying to update it and the twenty some odd utilities and dependencies it requires to run the bastard. One of my best friends is a programmer (no link, I don't think he wants people to associate us) and swears by command line utilities. "Nothing is as powerful" he says, with a straight face. I have never had as much trouble making any program work as I have had trying to make a fucking command line utility to function. </p>
<p>At any rate, the page looks wonderful and I'll keep working on it. Either that or I'll finally break down and offer my friend sexual favors for a banging new website. </p>
<h3>The "Facebook controversy"</h3>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag">video</a> concerning Facebook, content creators and advertising. Now, I'm not going to debate this video, I really just wanted to poke fun at anyone who didn't see this coming. <em>Of course you have to pay!</em> What, did artists really think that they'd be able to use Facebook as a De facto web-page service and never be forced to pay? Facebook is a for profit company, and it was only a matter of time before they would spring on all the people using Facebook as their home base.</p>
<p>In case you didn't watch the video or haven't followed the uproar, the basic point is this: non promoted content is not reaching people as effectively as advertising. That's it. That's what people are upset about, up until now they thought they were getting a free promotion platform, no strings attached. Now they are upset and making an uproar on the Internet because they think that it's unfair for Facebook to promote paid advertising ahead of their user generated content. Personally, I think Facebook is acting exactly as one would expect a huge, expensive for-profit company to act. The people I'm upset with are the idiots complaining about it. </p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>Nothing is free. Nothing.</h3>
<p>Really, the basic proposition is farcical if you write it down: creatives using Facebook as a promotional service shouldn't have to pay advertising fees to ensure that their content is seen by their followers. There are so many things wrong with that idea, I can't even get into them all, or even part of them. Really, I just want to make fun of all the pissed off people for thinking that they were getting something for free and that it would stay that way. </p>
<p>Lets break down exactly what they were getting:a free web page, and most of the benefits that come with it. That's what they were getting. It looked nice, it was stable, they had a web address they could send people to. They had as many or as few features as they wanted, all without any programming knowledge or outlay of cash. Basically they had a fancy Angelfire page that they didn't have to pay for. </p>
<p>Well, now you're paying for it. For years now people have used Facebook as a homepage and now it's not free, not if you're trying to use it as an advertising platform. Again, NOTHING IS FREE, why are people surprised by this? What incentive does Facebook have to be "loyal" to all these people? If anything, they are lucky Facebook doesn't just institute a pay to play policy for commercial uses. It would be perfectly fair for Facebook to impose a fee for people who are EXPRESSLY using their service to try and sell their content. </p>
<h3>Get off your ass and run a real business</h3>
<p>What really chaps me about these idiots making an uproar, is that they are completely dependent on other people. No one even thinks of having their own website, yet any real band has one. <a href="http://www.deftones.com/">The Deftones</a> have a web page, <a href="http://snoopdogg.com/">Snoop D, Oh, Double Gizzo</a> has a web page. Check the link, it's his name. </p>
<p>So why would an artist think "Yea, I don't need a real web page to look professional, a Facebook page should do." Not everyone can program and not everyone can drop the money to have a professional web site created, but there are just thousands and thousands of ways to get your own web page without spending a ton. God help you, if you take the time you could even just make your own damn site. Hell, this is a static site I build using <a href="www.getnikola.com">Nikola</a>. It was a bitch to install but once I learned markdown it's easy as pie. Easier than pie even. </p>
<p>The point is, if you want to be taken seriously, you act like your business is serious. If all you've got is SoundCloud and a Facebook link, I think you're a joke and most other people do too. When independent artists push fliers in my hand and it has a Facebook address at the bottom I just throw it away. You're not a real band yet. Of course I'm not saying that <em>all</em> it takes to be a real band is a web page, but it's one of the steps. Get over it, you can't use Facebook as a free web page/advertising platform. </p>
<h3>Oh Well</h3>
<p>I'll end my rant there, I don't really have a dog in this fight. I'm not performing yet, I've not got a following at all yet, but I have big plans and big ideas. I think about how I'm going to do it, what I need to do to get to the top. One of the first things I thought about to separate my self from the pack was my web presence. Thinking about that led me to the best question I can ask anyone who's pissed about Facebook:</p>
<p>If everyone else is already doing it, why did you want to do it too?</p></div>
