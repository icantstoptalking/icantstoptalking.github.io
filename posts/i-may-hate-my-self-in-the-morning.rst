But I love Terraria tonight. 

I'm an easy target when it comes to mindless clicking. I assume it's because I am simple minded, but few games satisfy like ones that require hours of grinding. World of Warcraft worked on me: hours turned into YEARS playing that game. Minecraft? Oh yea. One of the first couple thousand alpha players right here folks! I'm not sure who that would impress, but I am sure I don't want to meet that person. It comforts a very basic part of my brain when I can click away for a few hours and call it "productive" which is why I keep playing these games. Terraria requires just, _massive_ amounts of clicking, which makes me warm inside. Well, more warm. Pot makes me pretty warm too, and makes this game go from good to __GREAT!__
