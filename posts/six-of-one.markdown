##It all Sucks

I am too concerned with games. Games of all types, video games, board games, pen and paper role playing games. I love it all. Playing games is simply one of my favorite things to do. I enjoy games so much that it goes beyond playing them, I like thinking about them. It entertains me to ponder, at length, why this genre is more popular, who plays this game, why doesn't any one make this kind of game? Most of my friends and family probably dread talking to me, for fear of a long discussion about the various ups and downs of gaming and gaming culture. 

Video games aren't necessarily the first type of game I would choose to play. There are lots of games I would rather spend a few hours on than video games. The problem, and I doubt I'm alone here, is that video games are the easiest game to access. Half a dozen players and twelve hours to run a proper game of [Rifts](http://www.palladiumbooks.com) aren't always handy, but I can log into [WoW](www.worldofwarcraft.com) and [farm](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/gatherer) in minutes. This isn't a bad thing, it's good that games are so easy to play. I love having access to worlds of fantasy and adventure at my finger tips. I just wish video games were...better. 

##Put Down The Pitchforks

Games aren't bad, they are better than ever. Graphics are better now than ever before, there are more games on the market for a wider variety of systems. It's a golden age for gaming, it really is. The problem I have with video games right now comes down to value: are the games on offer worth the money they are charging? For most, clearly, the answer is yes. For me, no, not usually. 

Indie games feature neat ideas or unique hooks, but lack the substance and fullness of a AAA game. Indie games also can't offer the kind of support you get with a AAA title. No dedicated servers over on the indie crowd either. 

It's no better in AAA land. Yes, you get usually get a beautiful fully realized game. Unfortunately the common trend now is to break that game into enough pieces to release three DLC expansions. The graphics are amazing, but AAA games aren't allowed to have any fun now. If it's not strictly realistic, it will be torn to shreds by the press and the public. Probably the worse part of the AAA world is the fear. The companies that drop $50 million aren't going to let the developers take risks on unique hooks or new game mechanics.  

Either way, half a game: indie games cost $10.00 and come with that much or less content. AAA games have content a plenty, but you're going to have to buy it one piece at a time, only to know you're going to be sold the same thing again next year. 

##Indies are better because EA sucks. 

I would like to say right now that I was tempted to use finger quotes when I wrote indie. "Indie" perfectly describes how I feel about it. There have been truly independent games out there for a while, some more or less known. Dwarf Fortress is independent, Tarn Adams answers to no man and receives his income directly from the people who want to keep playing. It's crowd sourcing without the dirty taste in your mouth. Minecraft is independent: millions of copies sold created a company that neither takes money from investors or begs for it on Kickstarter. 

Now there is an "indie" scene. With the rise of Kickstarter, Steam Greenlight and the success of Minecraft it's become it's own genre. In fact, that is one of it's biggest problems. 

I can crap in a bag and call it an "indie" game. As long as you don't take money from EA or Ubisoft, you're indie. Some of the indie games I've played were barely games. I'm not talking about works in progress either, I mean games that were said to have been finished by the makers. Games that do exactly one thing, then repeat it for how ever long you can last. Since indie is a genre now, you can pretty much call anything an indie game and get away with it. Some are free, but many aren't. 

##It Gets Worse Than Unfinished Crap

I've tried countless tiny little snippets of entertainment called "indie games". If you make a proof of concept and give it away for free, who cares? Maybe you just wanted people to know that you can program some basic fluid simulation or a neat basketball game in HTML 5. That's great, fly your freak flag. What I'm bitching about, what I'm calling out, are _barely even started_ games being sold at full price. Think about that. Who usually plays unfinished games? The people who are _getting paid_ to play broken games as game testers. We've literally been recruited into paying to be testers. 

Whats wrong with that you say? So what, if someone wants to be a tester they should allowed to buy their way in. I agree, there should be a way for game companies (indie companies in particular) to crowd source testing. Charging people $26.99 [for a game with no declared release date](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/faq.php) isn't crowd sourcing. It's literally people paying for the honor of being an unpaid employee. I love KSP, but that's a lot of money for something that isn't even guaranteed to run reliably.  

It's amazing, it really is. I'm impressed that Steam has actually codified this and that every one is going along with it. They don't just enable and support it: [they actively pursue early investment](http://steamcommunity.com/games/765/announcements/detail/1585553420145694979). Again, stop and think about that. We call EA evil because they are a large publisher said to be callous towards their studios and customers. How caring is Steam being towards any of us, pushing unfinished games on us and expecting studios to sell unfinished games. Who is really benefiting?  

You are being asked to invest in a game that is often being made by a "studio" of two guys with no proof that they are going to make a complete, fleshed out game. Hell, nothing says they will ever get enough to finish the month, let alone the whole game. If you're one of a few people who actually buy in, then you and a few people are going to be bummed with the studio can't finish the game on $1200 worth of sales. You're being told, essentially that you can give these guys money and they might finish a game. No promises, no money back. Steam got your money and that's where their concern ends. 

Kickstarter, at least, is impartial. While games get a lot of press, they aren't that big a part of Kickstarter. A quick [peak at their stats page](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats) shows us that games are in the middle of the road, and include every kind of game, not just video games. Kickstarter doesn't care about your game, they have little to gain from it. Either you get it funded or you don't. They just want a cut. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, funding your game on Kickstarter, but it's clearly more impartial towards games than Steam. 

What is really frustrating is the lack of data to be able to really tell you how bad this set up is. The system is too new, the products that have been through Kickstarter or Steam Greenlight aren't matured yet, we don't know how it will work out. We DO know that a HUGE number of people are banking on this. That scares me. What is the world of video games going to look like after the current flight to indie is over? It's become a trend now, to leave your AAA studio to stat your own project. After the bottom falls out, won't we just be right back where we started: AAA studios dominating video games, in utter control of the talent pool? 

It's the value issue again. Do I want to pay good money for half a game or invest good money in a game that might or might not even see the light of day. I'm not saying $1.50 on Steam is bank busting, but think about it: is this game worth a hoot if they don't even care about how much they charge?

##Shut up fanboy, you're next

AAA titles across all the platforms have become an exercise in the surreal. Players keep buying games they say they don't want, developers keep making games they say they don't want to make. The games them selves are bland procedurals, rehashed properties treading a line between innovation and tradition, always with the aim to sell as many units as possible. Players will piss and moan, complain that nothing new was added, that even the graphics are a small step up from the last one, yet they line up by the millions and shell out $60.00 or more so they can go online and call each other faggots. 

Where it get's really absurd is my first point about AAA titles: every one claims to hate them, yet they are easily the most visible, most popular games each year. It's a tower of cards. The companies that make the game claim that they would love to take chances, claim that they hate anti-piracy software as much as we do, some even claim that D
