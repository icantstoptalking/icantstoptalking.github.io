Relax and enjoy &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/servile-purpose"&gt;Servile Purpose&lt;/a&gt;. I think it's about finished, so I'd like to talk about it a little bit, but first I need to do a little shilling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone is reading this, and &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; should be reading this, remember to follow me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/al_hacha"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; if you enjoy updates and thoughts at random. Please, make sure to dish out the "likes" like it's candy, every bit of encouragement helps makes this work (and helps me sell it to the ball and chain.) People say all this social networking is vital, and I suppose it is, but I think it's more vital for an established artist than for a "in the making" sort of performer such as my self. Oh well, even if I'm shouting into the wilderness, at least I'm shouting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put a new song up today &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/strange-dance"&gt;A Strange Dance&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to describe, I don't really think about any sort of classification when I'm making a song, I just kind of go for it. This one definitely came out as a dance song though. Very lively, very happy. I used a lot of major chords, kept it very simple. I like songs like this, because there is a nod to the current trend in electronic music and dance music, but I think it's more musical than the stuff on the radio. There is a definite beginning, middle and end to the song. Overall I guess I made a dance song that I'd want to dance to, rather than a dance song that would be popular right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm terrible at promoting my self, and I'm trying to get better through this page. So today I'm actually going to remember to remind anyone reading: don't forget to click the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/al_hacha"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; link at the top of the page as well as my &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; link. Follow me on both, it will make you feel toasty warm in your nether regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye for now, don't forget to DANCE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/150916234&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_artwork=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/a-strange-dance.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2014 08:42:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>You should've seen this coming</title><link>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/you-shouldve-seen-this-coming.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First, the following:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick rant today. I uploaded a few new tracks to my &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, got this website cleaned up and finally added all the buttons I want. I'm sure there will be more later, but for now this is more than enough. I think the next time I'm going to completely remake my web page is when I'm ready to have a "give me money for my music" link. Also, computers are just terrible. I encourage anyone who thinks that computers are "easy money" to spend their day forcing tools meant for &lt;a href="http://linuxfonts.narod.ru/why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; to work on &lt;a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/461353-10-Reasons-why-Windows-still-sucks"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day I got &lt;a href="http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; working after trying to update it and the twenty some odd utilities and dependencies it requires to run the bastard. One of my best friends is a programmer (no link, I don't think he wants people to associate us) and swears by command line utilities. "Nothing is as powerful" he says, with a straight face. I have never had as much trouble making any program work as I have had trying to make a fucking command line utility to function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the page looks wonderful and I'll keep working on it. Either that or I'll finally break down and offer my friend sexual favors for a banging new website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The "Facebook controversy"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; concerning Facebook, content creators and advertising. Now, I'm not going to debate this video, I really just wanted to poke fun at anyone who didn't see this coming. &lt;em&gt;Of course you have to pay!&lt;/em&gt; What, did artists really think that they'd be able to use Facebook as a De facto web-page service and never be forced to pay? Facebook is a for profit company, and it was only a matter of time before they would spring on all the people using Facebook as their home base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't watch the video or haven't followed the uproar, the basic point is this: non promoted content is not reaching people as effectively as advertising. That's it. That's what people are upset about, up until now they thought they were getting a free promotion platform, no strings attached. Now they are upset and making an uproar on the Internet because they think that it's unfair for Facebook to promote paid advertising ahead of their user generated content. Personally, I think Facebook is acting exactly as one would expect a huge, expensive for-profit company to act. The people I'm upset with are the idiots complaining about it. &lt;/p&gt;

It's a fun song, hopefully we'll see some action on the it. If anyone reads this and is interested in my other beats, I'm working as hard as I can on cleaning up my tracks and getting them ready. So be patient, very soon the world will be positively flooded with the sweet, soothing sounds of Al Hacha. As we speak I working on redesigning this site to reflect the change of focus and to maybe include some ways to buy my music, if you were so interested. Also, todays rant isn't so much pop culture as it is a personal gripe. Without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Onward!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing today about gear snobs. I frequent music blogs, forums and most often the popular rap production subreddit &lt;a href="http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop"&gt;Making Hip Hop&lt;/a&gt;. I've noticed a trend amongst the users of my various haunts: the proliferation of gear heads. That would be their own locution, I prefer to call them gear dicks. These guys love hanging out and letting people know that without the right gear, well, you're just screwed. You'll never make music as good as other people, these people of course, unless you step up and buy thousands of dollars of gear to make music. What a bunch of bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="more"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/missing-the-point.html"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/missing-the-point.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 07:36:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Moved On</title><link>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/moved-on.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I moved, didn't have internet for four months, finally got it back up. Now I'm sorting through web stuff I haven't looked at in months. I am updating this page (work in progress, clearly) my &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt; profile and my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/al_hacha"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; account. It's dreary work, I'd rather work on music than make new art assets, new content, update all my info etc, but this is part of the jam. I have no interest in trying to find a record company, so I suppose it's up to me to make all this crap happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's coming? Well, eventually this page will get a complete re-do. I'm going to continue to use this as a blog platform, as I have so many wonderful ideas to share. Mostly though new music is coming down the pipe line. I didn't waste my time off, I've got lots of tracks I'm working on right now and it's just a matter of deciding what I want to polish up for &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha"&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/a&gt;. I'd write more but I spent four hours getting everything back up and running and I'm frankly sick of staring at Vim editors. Yes, I use Vim and maintain this website my self. Why, jealous?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Blog</category><category>Update</category><category>news</category><guid>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/moved-on.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2014 13:36:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Kill Orcs &amp; Build A Better Marriage</title><link>http://www.icantstoptalking.com/posts/kill-orcs-build-a-better-marriage.html</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="round" src="http://www.icantstoptalking.com/OMDheader.jpg" alt="missing image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you play video games with your significant other, then I have one question: have you two played Orcs Must Die: 2 yet? If you aren't, you're missing out on a truly great time with someone you love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's Literally The Best&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot overstate how much I love Orcs Must Die: 2. I won't bore you with a &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, because I'm more focused on Orcs Must Die: 2 as a unique couples game, but it's a really great game besides. Here is a quick run down on why it's a good game to play no matter what:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orcs Must Die: 2 hits every high note. The graphics are colorful and well used. If you enjoy games that use graphics to transport you, rather than impress you, you'll love the graphics in this game. The sound perfectly fits the world and helps immersion. Sound cues are also used, particularly tough enemies that target the player howl as they enter a level. There are a variety of items to use and almost limitless replayabiltiy as you mix and match more effective trap combinations. My only real complaints would be somewhat sluggish controls as well as horrible controller support. Overall though, I recommend anyone play Orcs Must Die: 2, even if you're forever alone.
