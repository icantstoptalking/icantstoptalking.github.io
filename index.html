             Posted: <time class="published" datetime="2014-05-08T07:36:12">2014-05-08 07:36</time>
        </small></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Today I uploaded my new track <a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha/clean-out-my-mind-1">Clean Out My Mind</a>. It's a fun song, hopefully we'll see some action on the it. If anyone reads this and is interested in my other beats, I'm working as hard as I can on cleaning up my tracks and getting them ready. So be patient, very soon the world will be positively flooded with the sweet, soothing sounds of Al Hacha. As we speak I working on redesigning this site to reflect the change of focus and to maybe include some ways to buy my music, if you were so interested. Also, todays rant isn't so much pop culture as it is a personal gripe. Without further ado:</p>
<h3>Onward!</h3>
<p>I'm writing today about gear snobs. I frequent music blogs, forums and most often the popular rap production subreddit <a href="posts/www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop">Making Hip Hop</a>. I've noticed a trend amongst the users of my various haunts: the proliferation of gear heads. That would be their own locution, I prefer to call them gear dicks. These guys love hanging out and letting people know that without the right gear, well, you're just screwed. You'll never make music as good as other people, these people of course, unless you step up and buy thousands of dollars of gear to make music. What a bunch of bullshit. </p>
<h3>"It's just not the same"</h3>
<p>That is their battle cry. "It's just not the same." They are referring to the difference between hardware music equipment and software music tools. To be clear, I'm not talking about recording. Only the <em>most</em> hardcore gear dicks say you shouldn't record on a computer. It's just too damn easy, even your casual elitist won't argue that it's industry standard to record into the computer when you're ready to publish your music. Where the gear dick plants his flag is in the processing/creation stage. This means mixers handling synths, live instruments, turntables, effects boxes, compressors, etc... All the stuff you use to make or to alter music. </p>
<p>To clarify one more bit before I go off: I'm not talking about pros. A professional with a million dollar studio budget is going to have <em>everything.</em> Why wouldn't Dr. Dre use anything and everything he can to make great music? No, I'm not talking about professionals with plaques on their walls. I'm talking about the very loud crowd on the Internet that spend their time crapping on new rappers and arguing with old producers about how you're just not going to get the same kind of sound without hardware. Again, what a bunch of bullshit. </p>
<h3>I didn't pick this fight</h3>
<p>These guys tend to be pretty similar category: they all have lots of hardware, have been doing it for a long time, and never got farther than the regional scene, if that, most don't really do much at all. Have I made it big? No, why would I waste my time with this blog if I had? I am, however, capable of noticing patterns of abuse and the patterns of the abusers. These guys all seem to be local/regional producers with thousands of dollars in hardware and not nearly as much to show for it as they want. When they spent that money, when they turned the spare bedroom into a studio, they did it with the intention of making it big. There is nothing wrong with that, I want the same thing, but looking at their posts it's pretty clear why they are so angry:</p>
<p>Most of them haven't made it and probably won't. I'm not sure I'll make a career out of music, probably not. That's why I, and  most others, focus on education over buying gear. These gear dicks are a small minority, they are just loud and annoying. They spent thousands of dollars over years and never bothered to get any better. Who needs to make new, interesting songs if you can side chain till your head spins? So now they have an entire Internet to bitch at to make them selves feel better. At best they get some local talent to let them make a few tracks, but it's much more common for them to languish in obscurity, firing at every fresh faced young rapper or producer who's trying to make it. </p>
<h3>The Equipment Doesn't Make The Music</h3>
<p>Well shit, all that gear and you're not famous? What the hell? This is where the circle starts, you can look at years and years worth of Internet comments and blog posts to see the pattern. These guys are addicted, they keep thinking that the next piece of gear is what's going to make the difference and take them to the next step. They still play music, they probably spend quite a bit of time trying to improve, but to them the main source of improvement for their music comes from gear. Since gear is more important than <em>how to actually make music</em> they focus on how to use their gear rather than on learning how to make music.  </p>
<p>It's a head spinning process reading these guys thoughts on the Internet. Even when people try to point out that it's more important to work on your self than on your gear they simply turn a deaf ear and continue. Voice sounds thin? Can't be you, it's gotta be the hardware, the process. Your mic isn't good enough, you need better cable, your mixer is washing out all your lows and that's why it sounds crappy. Same on the production side. The kick isn't hitting hard enough because you're not using the right gear. They might not tell you to get a full drum set, but they will damn well write reams about how it's just not the same as a <em>real</em> drum pad. </p>
<p>This is how they answer literally, ever goddamn question. Even the ones they have no reason to comment on, they have to inject their thoughts on your lack of professional gear. They rarely run their own blogs, they rarely make the reddit thread. They know they would come off poorly starting a thread about how: "You guys suck for not having hardware mixers!" So instead they wait until someone asks something and pounce, declaring "You're never going to get it to sound right without (insert crazy expensive hardware component.) </p>
<h3>My personal truth</h3>
<p>Here's why I call shenanigans: very few of us amateurs are ever going to make money doing this. It's the truth. I haven't made a cent yet and I probably won't, and that's a huge part of my complaint: they are honestly stating that you cannot make good music, music that people will listen to, until you have invested in expensive hardware. That's a key point, it's not just that you have a mixer, it's that you don't have the <em>right</em> mixer. They tell everyone they can that you're wasting your time without gear, which, again, is so much bullshit.   </p>
<p>Yes, as you progress and your skills grow you will need more gear. I started out with nothing but a computer. Now I have a small mixer, a small midi keyboard, some electronic drums and a bass. I also have an old dynamic mic and a mic stand with a pop filter. Here's the thing though: My computer is still the most expensive part of this deal by far, and that's because it was a gaming rig first. My keyboard? The <a href="http://www.alesis.com/q25">Alesis Q25</a>, less than $60.00 on special. I have heard it said many times on the Internet that it's crap. Amongst the many good reviews on GuitarCenter, there were plenty of people bemoaning the poor quality of the keyboard. Hell, I actually own the thing, I could bitch all day, but I had absolutely no reason to spend more. </p>
<p>Same with my control surface:<a href="http://www.korg.com/us/products/controllers/nanokontrol2/">The Korg nanoKontrol 2</a> it was cheap as hell. I think my wife got it on special for $50.00 bucks. It's not nearly as nice as the Behringer BCF2000, at least according to the Internet and some reviews. But the superior controller also cost way the hell more and had a ton of features I would like, but have no real need of. I had some need of a control surface. I didn't need a full mixer, or sixteen channels. Hell, I'm a minimalist, I don't <em>want</em> 16 channels now. I won't use 16 channels right now, so why spend more?</p>
<p>The jerks who want to crap on you, gear dicks who insist that hip-hop can only be born of money, they want to make it too, but they haven't and they spent like they did, so they want to make sure no one else makes it. I hate discouragement, I hate elitist dicks who want to tell us what to do. This is 2014, I have a better chance of making it through skill, hard work and clever use of the Internet than anyone before has. I mean to make it, and to hell with the haters. They might have more gear than me, but when I listen to their music I'm doing things they aren't. Damn near everyone is better than the gear dicks. </p>
<h3>Wrap it up Al</h3>
<p>Yes, it's not a big deal over all. They are a minority. Most of the people on the threads are decent guys who don't try to discourage people. It's easy to ignore them and move on with life. Sometimes it just gets under my skin, so today I decided to bitch about it. I know they aren't going to change and I know it's apparently part of human nature to compete over material items, but it makes my blood boil when some half assed "producer" with more money than brains tries to tell me I can't be as good as him without his gear. </p>
<p>Fuck them, they might have more gear, but I have a Rockband drum converted to midi, and a dick big enough to tell them I think they are ass holes. </p>
<p>Before you leave, enjoy my new track:</p>

        <hr>
        <p>So I moved, didn't have internet for four months, finally got it back up. Now I'm sorting through web stuff I haven't looked at in months. I am updating this page (work in progress, clearly) my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha">Soundcloud</a> profile and my <a href="https://twitter.com/al_hacha">Twitter</a> account. It's dreary work, I'd rather work on music than make new art assets, new content, update all my info etc, but this is part of the jam. I have no interest in trying to find a record company, so I suppose it's up to me to make all this crap happen. </p>
<p>So what's coming? Well, eventually this page will get a complete re-do. I'm going to continue to use this as a blog platform, as I have so many wonderful ideas to share. Mostly though new music is coming down the pipe line. I didn't waste my time off, I've got lots of tracks I'm working on right now and it's just a matter of deciding what I want to polish up for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/al_hacha">Soundcloud</a>. I'd write more but I spent four hours getting everything back up and running and I'm frankly sick of staring at Vim editors. Yes, I use Vim and maintain this website my self. Why, jealous?</p>

        <hr>
        <p><img class="round" src="OMDheader.jpg" alt="missing image"></p>
<p>If you play video games with your significant other, then I have one question: have you two played Orcs Must Die: 2 yet? If you aren't, you're missing out on a truly great time with someone you love. </p>
<h3>It's Literally The Best</h3>
<p>I cannot overstate how much I love Orcs Must Die: 2. I won't bore you with a <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/orcs-must-die!-2">review</a>, because I'm more focused on Orcs Must Die: 2 as a unique couples game, but it's a really great game besides. Here is a quick run down on why it's a good game to play no matter what:</p>
<p>Orcs Must Die: 2 hits every high note. The graphics are colorful and well used. If you enjoy games that use graphics to transport you, rather than impress you, you'll love the graphics in this game. The sound perfectly fits the world and helps immersion. Sound cues are also used, particularly tough enemies that target the player howl as they enter a level. There are a variety of items to use and almost limitless replayabiltiy as you mix and match more effective trap combinations. My only real complaints would be somewhat sluggish controls as well as horrible controller support. Overall though, I recommend anyone play Orcs Must Die: 2, even if you're forever alone.
<!-- TEASER_END -->
There are a few things, specifically, that Orcs Must Die: 2 does well that recommends it for couples. First, of course, is the fact that it's truly cooperative, which is rare. Second,losing is fun, which is the difference between arguing over the defeat and happily starting another game. Lastly, and my favorite benefit: it offers a unique way to interact with someone you love, which is nearly priceless </p>
<h3>What's your point?</h3>
<p>There are lot of good games to play, many if not most are multi player. There are more ways than ever to play with your partner covering just about every genre imaginable. I think, and I will try to explain why, that Orcs Must Die: 2 goes beyond simply playing together and becomes and unique experience you can share with someone. The unique combination of tower defense and action gaming creates a situation where you actively get closer to your significant other as you game. </p>
<h3>Co-op? What?</h3>
<p>True cooperative games are hard to come by, and they always have been. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, those old NES "co-op" games were just two people on the same screen, there was very little actual cooperation. There is a difference between playing as a team and playing together. This goes for most games, really. Unless you've taken the time to practice acting as a team, your average multi player game simply pits people against each other, and some people (your team mates) can't be killed, so you vaguely work with them. More often though, in Team Fortress 2 for example, you work for and by your self. Orcs Must Die: 2 grades the team, not the person. Most other game there is a individual winner. In a "team" game of Battlefield there is a #1 at the end. The highest ranked person on the losing team still feels like a winner. He accomplished <em>his</em> goal, so he won regardless of how his team fared. </p>
<p>A true cooperative experience means you depend on each other for a team victory. Whatever your individual accomplishments are it comes secondary to winning as a team. Look at team sports: even if you're breaking records you can't win without a team working as a unit. We've all played enough video games to know that good players can often carry weak teams on their shoulders. Before first person shooters matured into more complex games, you could win for your team singly handily if there was enough of a talent gap. If you want to act as a team, you worry about how other players are doing, not just your own performance.  </p>
<p>When you play Orcs Must Die:2 co-op you will find it almost impossible to win without your partner. Your items are halved when playing co-op, along with your in game currency used to buy traps. At the very start of the game you are dependent on your partner, you cannot win without them. So, first thing you have to do is start cooperating. What items are you buying? What traps do you want to use? Before my wife and I start a game there is a good five minutes just discussing what we think will work the best. This is followed by buying our items together to maximize our chance at a team victory. </p>
<p>The depth here is hard to enumerate. The traps, weapons, and trinkets all work together in unique ways, which is compounded when they are being used by another person. You absolutely have to state clearly how you are trying to accomplish victory. You'll start communicating with your partner, it might not be the most profound communication, but it's better than staring at two screens doing two different things. </p>
<h3>Couples that lose together, win together.</h3>
<p>It sucks losing, no two bones about it. We all hate losing and I don't know anyone but <a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Fun">Dwarf Fortress</a> players who enjoy losing. It's fair to say that losing gets worse when you have someone to blame, and to blame you. I've seen grown men go red in the face, outraged at the poor play of a team mate. I could list games for hours that absolutely suck to lose and suck even harder because some idiot took the plane and crashed it into a mountain.</p>
<p>It's not a great idea to spend time together, being frustrated at one another. That's not really hard to find, a long trip to Walmart should probably provide all the arguments your relationship needs. When you lose at Orcs Must Die: 2, it's more like a slap on the wrist than a smack down. </p>
<p>When the two of you lose you'll laugh instead of growl. It's hard to blame anyone when you were both scrambling just to keep up with the enemies flooding you. There isn't time to fight over who blew it (the other person, of course) because you both want to get back into another fight. We don't argue because we are both excited about trying a new trap or trick. </p>
<p>When my wife continually falls into vats of lava (three in one game) I find my self chuckling. It's funny, theres not way around it. I know we should be working together, and we are, but it's just too damn funny hearing her mutter "fuck!" and then see her points come off the counter. I get my comeuppance when she has to save me from a group of monsters. (Monsters that I totally could have handled.)</p>
<p>Ten minutes later we've lost again, laughing, loading the level to take another crack at it. This is important. This cannot be under rated. There are a million reason to be frustrated with modern living. When you live with someone, now there are even more things to worry about failing at. It's a great relief to spend time together where it doesn't matter if you lose, it just makes the day more fun.  </p>
<h3>You may not have seen this before</h3>
<p>Some people say it's wrong to be competitive, it's rude to have a drive to win. Often, we try to hide that side of our character, the part of you that wants to grind someone into the ground in triumph. Often it's frowned on to want to win. </p>
<p>Bullocks. Not only is being competitive great, it's even better seeing the person you love getting riled up, ready to win. It's something you just don't see in a person all the time. If you play sports together, or often compete together, then this probably doesn't apply to you. Clearly, if you can work on a team together you know exactly how hot it is seeing your significant other just wailing on someone, and you don't need me telling you how great it is.  </p>
<p>Those of us of a more...cerebral temperament, don't have as many chances. It's not surprising, many of us haven't competed in <em>anything</em> besides video games since we dropped out of fast pitch baseball. Our partners will tend be of similar temperament. I'm sure it happens, but I doubt it's common for the cross country runner to marry the avid gamer. So, it follows, that it would be hard to find a chance to really compete on the same team as your partner. If you haven't even seen the competitive side of your partner, you're missing out. </p>
<p>You will be amazed at how attractive your partner is when you're winning and losing together. It shouldn't be a surprise: for thousands of years couples have depended on one another just to survive, you often saw your partner giving everything they have to just to survive. Now, with the lack of struggle and the civilized nature of us spoiled westerners, it's more likely you'll see your partner struggling with a hard boss than struggling to overcome adversity. </p>
<p>Video games aren't adversity, but if you can't watch your wife kick ass at softball than a video game is the next best thing. My wife gets super angry when she loses and is highly competitive. It's even better when we're on the same team. She cheers me on, helps me, asks for help. When we go shopping, or live our daily lives its the steady route: we all just get through the day. Being competitive just isn't something you get to see. But it's fantastic when you do. </p>
<h3>Play Games, Be Happy</h3>
<p>This isn't advice, it's just one mans opinion. Don't try to solve a rough relationship with video games, any more than you would with booze or swinging. This isn't something that will solve anything for you, it's something that will add to what you already have. Do you love your boyfriend/girlfriend? Do you enjoy spending time with the person you love, husband or wife? </p>
<p>This isn't going to make a bad life good, but it will make a good life better. You'll love the time you spend with your spouse or partner even more. It's one more thing to share stories about, to look forward to, to enjoy together.  </p>
